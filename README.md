# All-Magisk-Module-Compatible-With-Redmi-12
In this repo I have mentioned some of the magisk module that are compatible with Redmi 12 (codename: Fire) I have tested these modules on HyperOS 2 (specifically on 2.0.202.0 Indian ROM)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Redmi 12 (codename "fire") modules collection! This repository lists some of the best Magisk modules and tweaks that work smoothly on Xiaomi Redmi 12 (MediaTek Helio G88 chipset) devices. These modules enhance your device’s performance, customization, and overall experience without compromising stability. Since this is a low-end device some features are locked out (EG: iOS style control centre, Advanced Blur etc)

> [!WARNING]  
> Please keep in mind that the modules mentioned needs root access via Magisk, while getting the access is not hard, it does carry a risk of soft bricking your device also rooting requires unlocking the Bootloader which will void your warrenty (if any)

##Unlocking The Bootloader
Xioami usually locks the bootloader on its devices for reasons like privacy, to protect against malware, and prevent any modifications to the device that they do not want. While most other phone brands do the same you can unlock the BL with a permission (differ from brand to brand). Xiaomi also require you to do the same, they have recently changed the unlock requirements, like CN (mainland china) model have a diff method to unlock the bootloader. To get the permission you have to apply for unlock bootloader in the Xiaomi community app, which will allways give you a error, no matter the time or the number of times you try. So then to get the permission you would have to contact someone who speciallizes in unlocking the bootloader (@robon3xus on telegram is one these guys, he is legit, i unlocked my BL with his help), they will get you the permission after that follow the below steps:
1. Go to the setttings app --> About Phone --> Tap 7 time on OS version
2. Go back to the main Settings screen --> Aditional Setting (scroll down) --> Developer Options
3. Enable OEM unlocking (will probably ask for confirmation)
4. Go to MI unlock status --> Agree (the popup named Permission required) --> Add account and device (needs Mobile Data and a Mi account at least 30 days or older) --> If it says success or simillar proceed, if not try again after a few min
5. Download the MI Flash Unlock tool from any reputable website or from thie repo
